===================================================================
v 0.0.0.0

mamaich:
- implemented all client/server encryption modes
- Injection window is now resizeable and is processed in parallel thread
- Plugins are supported
- Implemented a world class. All items in the world are now stored in memory
  for simplified access. Every 10 minutes or on ",debug 3" command the world
  is cleaned from the items that are too far away from the player.
- Information about player and reagents is displayed on window caption.
- All containers in player's backpack with graphics == i_backpack or i_bag are 
  automatically searched for reagents. 
- Injection output to the client window now has 3 colors: green for normal 
  messages, yellow for warnings and bold red for errors.
- Added a "Skills" tab. Doubleclick on the specific cell in grid to change 
  sorting mode or skill lock.
- Added a "Multiple UO" plugin
- Started to write a "high level" API
- Made a small installer
- Launcher now can be used to start client
- POL server is now supported
- Added UseObject/UseType commands

Bugs/features:
- UOTD client sometimes deadlocks on exit after too many login/logouts. 
  Bug in client itself?
- Too lazy to write a code for removing an added tab... :)
- Sphere server/client bug: when login server and game server both have the same 
  IP address 127.0.0.1 on a computer that is not connected to LAN, client does 
  not close login socket and reuses it for the game encryption. But sphere server
  does not change its encryption and is unable to process game packets.
- Old clients (2.0.0 and alike) crash on Win98. New or 3D clients work fine.
  All clients work fine on 2K/XP.
- Launcher sometimes crashes after starting client. I'm unable to reproduce
  this error on the debug build.
